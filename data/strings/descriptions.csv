# Ships,,,,,
,,,,,
vass_makhaira,SHIP,"Possibly the oldest of the ships still in production by Vass Shipyards, the Makhaira has been redesigned numerous times since its inception. The most recent model has been relegated to a supporting role in most of the families' fleets, either as combat support or as a smuggling vessel. Its unique shipsystem allows it to make much more risky maneuvers than expected without running the risk of being punished.

Initially designed in a manner similar to a sports car, the Makhaira's external look actually hasn't changed much since its first version. The same, however, can't be said about the interior components. The first Makhaira designs are thought to outdate the Periodic Plating by at least a couple of decades by conservative estimates, and with the sole exception of the luxurious captain's quarters the entirety of the ship's internal structure has been redesigned from scratch on multiple occasions.

The newest model in active production, sometimes nicknamed the Makhaira Reverter, started appearing in Vass fleets around cycle 90. The biggest addition over earlier designs is the Temporal Retreat system, which only finished prototyping a cycle or so earlier. Using some of the most recent inventions in macro-scale type-2 chrono reversion technology, this Recipro system can bring the ship 'back in time' a couple of seconds, undoing almost all effects or damage inflicted during this time. As the system's electronics takes up nearly twenty percent of the ship's volume, some smugglers within the Vass families still prefer the superior cargo capacity of older models. However, these are rarely if ever deployed as warships.

There are rumors about a new Makhaira model in the works, going under several varied names such as the Makhaira X, the Makhaira Penultimate and the Makhaira Multiplexer. However, no reliable details exist, and any information available is either simple myth or highly speculative in nature.",,,

vass_akrafena,SHIP,"The most recent ship from the Vass Shipyards to exit prototyping, the Akrafena is a highly advanced attack vessel specifically designed to help the families bring much-needed firepower to a fleet in a frigate-sized package. While its engagement angle and weapon arcs leave much to desire, its blend of survivability and firepower has quickly made it a popular choice for ship captains in the families.

While only starting to appear in general fleet use around cycle 198, rumors about a ship with similar properties have been existent for at least 30 cycles before that. Unlike the more common Makhaira, the Akrafena was built from the ground up as a combat vessel first and foremost. Barely any space on the ship is reserved for cargo, and while the crew compartments may be luxurious by Sector standards, among the families they cannot be called anything less than spartan in design. 

Perhaps most modern of all is the ship's Isochronal Field Projector. Partly based on the much more limited Fragarach weapon system, this strange device allows a ship to displace projectiles from and to neighboring timelines, effectively allowing it to 'multiply' its own weapon loadout at will, or selectively pick enemy projectiles from nearby realities which are less likely to hit it. While not completely without limit, the system can easily turn the tide of battle when used correctly. Unfortunately, the technology simply isn't stable enough to maintain multiple independently calibrated fields at once, and as such must manually switch between protecting the ship and multiplying its own projectiles.",,,
,,,,,
vass_schiavona,SHIP,"As much a bragging right as a warship, the infamous Schiavona is the most mobile ship employed by the Vass families. Its fearsome Periodic Breaker system allows it to punch far above what its meager weapon loadout would imply.

Commonly used for hunter-killer duty, the ship is extremely fast and is capable of catching almost all known vessels both in- and out of a combat scenario unprepared. Accel in particular are known to use entire small fleets consisting of nothing but Schiavonas to hunt down those who cross them, earning it the nickname 'Lain's Bloodhound' in certain circles.

Of special note is its Periodic Breaker system, often considered the most defining feature of the ship. The device accelerates the ship's timeflow to near-infinite levels, creating the illusion of time standing still for everything outside its sphere of influence. A side-effect of this is an extremely loud, almost tearing sound, which expands far outside the area directly affected by the system. In fact, for reasons still not entirely documented, this sound seems to travel without carrying mediums: it can be heard aboard other vessels despite being several kilometers away with nothing but the emptiness of space inbetween.",,,
,,,,,
vass_curtana,SHIP,"Primary carrier of the Vass families, the Curtana compensates for its comparatively low fighter count with advanced refit systems and decent front-line performance. Specializes in short, spread-out fighter strikes and fleet support, but is still capable of holding its own in a fight and is surprisingly fast for its size.

Hurriedly developed shortly after the Collapse in an attempt to reinforce Vass fleets for the heavier fighting that appeared in its wake, the Curtana was built from the ground-up with care taken to the unique position of the five families. Being constantly starved for manpower, a lot of focus was put on ensuring fighter crew safety. Rather than using several concurrently deployed fighter wings, this ship relies on a comparatively small amount of fighter bays with advanced quick-replacement fighter bays capable of keeping up the pressure without needing to have more fighters in the air at once. While the ship's interior design became fairly odd from the special requirements of this system, with a shaft stretching from its rear fighter bay all the way to the front of the ship, the reduced mass required for the smaller amount of fighter forges means the ship can keep a higher speed than most comparable carriers: a critical fact as it needs to keep up with other Vass ships to be of any use in a fleet setting. The empty shaft can also be quickly adapted to work as a 360-degree projector screen for crewmembers when the ship is not in an active warzone.

More recently, almost all existing Curtana have been retro-fitted with the Chrono Jump system to reduce their vulnerability to high-alpha attacks from enemy ships and bombers. While some fleet commanders complain about 'those bloody carrier technicians punting reapers up our bungholes', the overall combat effectiveness of the system has made such complaints fairly rare.",,,
,,,,,
vass_estoc,SHIP,"The primary bomber employed by most of the Vass families, the Estoc is an extremely fast bomber with a peculiar payload specialized for striking unprotected hull and weapons. It also features a Temporal Recall system allowing it to very quickly return to the carrier after a bombing run.

Developed in tandem with the Curtana, the Estoc was the families' first response to the heavier fighting they were forced to partake in after the Collapse. While not the only bomber developed in this transitional period of Vass doctrine, its powerful blend of powerful weapons, decent durability and massive speed allowed it to quickly become the dominant Vass bomber.

An Estoc is piloted by two crew each: one pilot and one engineer. The pilot controls the ship's thrusters and also handles bomb-dropping. Meanwhile, the engineer is responsible for keeping all the highly-volatile systems online while in a combat situation. Originally, the vessel only had one crew member fulfilling both roles. However, the myriad of different systems that need to be fine-tuned could not be automated properly resulting in multiple casualties early during development. To remedy this, a second seat was added just above the original one. Due to the late stage of adding this seat, it is almost unique in its design: not only does the seat face the other way compared to the pilot's seat, it is also so cramped for space that the engineer has to practically lay on their stomach mere inches from the pilot's head to properly operate all the equipment. This, combined with the relative crew safety of the design and a requirement for the two crew members to be in near-perfect sync, has given it the nickname 'matchmaker' among some family members.",,,
,,,,,
vass_katzbalger,SHIP,"The newest fighter vessel developed by Vass Shipyards, the Katzbalger is a distraction fighter intended to draw firepower away from more important targets. While its firepower is underwhelming, it is decently durable and its system allows it to distract more firepower than other comparable fighters for short bursts of time.

Entering production as late as cycle 183, the Katzbalger still has a reputation for being new and unreliable. While overall using considerably less unstable components than most Vass ships, this does not mean it uses tried-and-tested technology; not by a longshot. The primary system mounted in the Katzbalger was a point of heated discussion among the families: Accel wanted to mount their prototype miniaturized Periodic Breaker system, while Multa insisted on mounting its new visual timeline accessor they'd perfected during the last few cycles. Accel still mostly use their own variant of the Katzbalger, however the other families agreed to use the model suggested by Multa.",,,

# Weapons,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
vass_dyrnwyn,WEAPON,"A simplistic but powerful weapon developed as a joint project between Accel and Perturba, the Dyrnwyn is effectively a highly customized Pulse Laser in a sleek housing. A miniature time accelerator is housed in the weapon which, while too power-heavy to activate normally, has been designed to run on the residual energy of nearby chrono-instabilities.

The Dyrnwyn is notable for lacking Torpor components, which is otherwise a staple in Vass engineering to protect from nearby timeline manipulation and distortion. Housing a device powered by such distortions meant this was not an option, so the weapon is instead built as rugged and durable as possible to avoid permanent damage. Despite this, however, the weapon is infamous among maintenance engineers for constantly receiving interior damage in ways nearly impossible to predict and needing constant supervision lest the device malfunctions in combat.",General,,
,,,,,
vass_cyllel_farchog,WEAPON,"The logical extreme of the Dyrnwyn blaster, the Cyllel Farchog can lay down a nothing short of terrifying wall of fire. Effectively six stripped-down Dyrnwyns with linked fire systems strapped into a temporally semi-stabilized casing, its main weaknesses is its low efficiency at dealing with spaceship armor and its poor accuracy.

Unlike the Dyrnwyn it is derived from the Cyllel Farchog does in fact use chrono-stabilizer components in most parts of the gun, with the main energy generation chamber being the notable exception. Being extremely cramped for space due to this, the gun barrels couldn't feasibly be pointed in the correct direction forcing the entire gun to be built around a comparatively crude electromagnet that redirects the ionized ordinance as it leaves the six barrels of the gun. This gives it lackluster accuracy, but its high rate-of-fire and the immense savings on maintenance are generally considered worth it.",General,,
,,,,,
vass_asi,WEAPON,"An attempt to weaponize the inertia-based oddities caused by time acceleration and deceleration, the Asi is a peculiar hybrid of a railgun, coilgun and particle accelerator. Shifting between slowing down time and speeding up time, it can fire a metallic slug at speeds great enough to flash into plasma on contact, giving it a damage profile more akin to an explosive.

While a railgun is normally limited in its speed by how long the barrel is and the strength of its magnets, the unique effects of time acceleration and deceleration changes the playing field entirely. Decelerating the projectile's timeflow during the acceleration phase of the weapon, and then swiftly 'switching polarities' on the device to vastly accelerate the timeflow means that the slug has more time to accelerate down the barrel, while still getting a much higher barrel velocity than conventional weapons of comparable size.

The weapon would be considered nothing short of revolutionizing in the field of warfare were it not for its exorbitant price and the fact that it's nearly impossible to upscale. In fact, the various temporal mechanics required for its operation without an exponentially higher energy cost only align properly at two known sizes: one being the size used on the Asi, and the other being on the nanometer scale.",General,,
,,,,,
vass_yawarakai_te,WEAPON,"A strange mix of laser refractor and chrono-destabilizer, the Yawarakai-Te is one of the more unique point-defense solutions in the sector. While the instabilities generated by it are too weak to actually destroy incoming ordinance, it gives a very good chance of leaving them inert and harmless.

The Yawarakai-Te was initially a test bed for a beam-carried chronoinstability weapon. However, the beam itself was distorted too much to maintain cohesion at any longer ranges, and the damage resulting from the weapon was much less than initially expected. After almost thirty years with no notable progress, the entire project was scrapped and funding was pulled. The hundred or so prototypes that remained were shipped off to a remote facility in the Persean sector to be hidden away, in case new technology in the field appeared sometime in the future.

The story of the weapon would most likely have ended there, had it not been for the Collapse. With the Persean sector now destabilized and violent, the Perturba faced problems they never had to deal with before. Notably, almost all Perturba ships were outfitted for minor skirmishes at most, and completely lacked defenses against the military-grade missiles that now saturated the sector. Scrambling for a solution that didn't rely on external weapon manufacturers, the old prototypes for the Yawaratai-Te were rediscovered. The lackluster damage profile was tweaked to allow it to hurt guidance and arming mechanisms in missiles, and new refractory lenses were mounted to allow the weapon to be placed in a fixed casing but still aim at incoming ordinance near-instantaneously. While beam cohesion never was solved, its effects were mitigated by simply using more beam emitters at once. This also had the bonus of allowing multiple missiles to be targeted at once, albeit at reduced power.",Missile Defense,,
,,,,,
vass_makhaira_builtin,WEAPON,"Very similar to the Yawarakai-Te, the Juuchi Yosamu is an integrated missile defense solution developed by Perturba specifically for the Makhaira. While its overall power is greater than its smaller modular sibling, the large energies involved means it needs several independent emission ports across the ship, limiting its ability to focus down high-value targets.",Missile Defense,,
,,,,,
vass_caladbolg,WEAPON,"A cannon with such an oversized bore that it has no right fitting in a medium mount, the Caladbolg relies on a novel chrono-reversal mechanism to load new (or rather, old) shells back into its chamber. An unfortunate consequence of this is a lowered firerate at long ranges.

Mostly a tech demo in compact chrono-reversal technology, the shells of the Caladbolg are to-date the smallest such devices in widespread use. While prototype 'ejection seats' of sorts have been created that are technically smaller, they are still prohibitively expensive even by Vass standards and thus only in use by a select few individuals. That's not to say the Caladbolg's shells are a cheap piece of technology; they are still expensive enough to rival that of the cannon it's fired out of.

Said cannon is actually surprisingly simple: a (relatively) simple timeflow-stabilized tracking device for the shells to home in on, a system for injecting and igniting propellant, and solid rifled barrel with a slide-mechanism breach. The breach is mostly used to disperse any unignited propellant and to ensure the chrono-reversal process can be undergone without risk of jamming the barrel. Early prototypes without this breach mechanism tended to have the shot reverted a degree or so off from the original state, causing shots to get stuck in the barrel on ignition and subsequently destroy the entire weapon from the inside out.",Assault,,
,,,,,
vass_fragarach,WEAPON,"One of the very few cases of weaponized multi-timeline manipulation, the Fragarach can hit targets it by all rights should have missed by 'grazing' nearby timelines. It is primarily a weapon for knocking out shields, but can be used quite effectively as a PD solution as well.

The Fragarach is the Multa family's first (successful) attempt at weapons manufacture. At its core, it is a coilgun with an intentionally bad barrel stabilization and circuits that are extremely prone to react to instabilities in the ship's flux grid. What this means is that even extremely small changes when firing, almost down to the atomic level, can cascade into a wildly different exit angle for the projectile. While these aspects might appear to be massive flaws to any conventional weapon, they are absolutely critical for the Fragarach.

One of the core issues with timeline-grazing technology is that timelines that interact must be 'close' to each other. What exactly this 'closeness' entails is a hotly debated subject, but one of the most generally accepted theories is that two timelines are close if their causes are close; that is to say, the smaller the differing 'events' between the timelines, the closer they are. This is exploited to the extreme in the Fragarach, as individual quantum effects can cause the weapon to miss by several degrees and seemingly at random. This means that while the different timelines of the projectile are far away 'geometrically', they are somehow still close 'chronically', allowing the weapon's effects to be considerably more far-reaching than a normal coilgun fielding the technology would be.",Assault/PD,,
,,,,,
vass_tizona,WEAPON,"An early but time-tested design by Perturba, the Tizona is a powerful chrono-distortion weapon capable of wrecking absolute havoc on unprotected hull and equipment.

While classed as the smallest weapon sold by Perturba that still can be called a 'spaceship weapon', the Tizona is still nothing to scoff at. It operates on a similar principle as the smaller weapons of its ilk: trigger a chronic instability that causes anything that moves or changes rapidly to literally rip itself apart when its timelines are no longer locally aligned. This is almost entirely harmless against most simple structures and terrain, however electronics, machinery and especially living beings are nearly guaranteed to be utterly destroyed even by grazing hits. The sheer horror of the terribly contorted bodies left after such an attack can often be an effective terror weapon in its own right.

Even though the principle is very similar, the Tizona has one aspect that is different from its smaller variations, namely the delivery mechanism. Hand-held and vehicle-fired munitions usually fire the actual pulse generation device itself at the target; while costly and impractical, there is no feasible way to transport the pulse any decent distance on such a small scale, especially when atmospheric disturbance has to be taken into account. The Tizona instead uses more sophisticated plasma-orb-based method of delivery, made possible by its increase in size and its focus on operation in a near-vacuum environment.",Strike/Suppression,,
,,,,,
vass_colada,WEAPON,"A simple Tizona modification made to better fit the Schiavona's sleek exterior, the Colada is functionally just a Tizona emitter hidden under the hull with extended capacitor banks and a more direct link-up to the ship's generator system for easier recharge mid-combat.",Strike/Suppression,,
,,,,,
vass_excalibur,WEAPON,"Mostly an overclocked Tizona, the Excalibur Emitter releases its entire stored energy at once instead of delivering it piecemeal like its smaller counterpart. While overall efficiency has decreased because of this, the attack-retreat-repair doctrine of the Estoc means that alpha-strike potential far outweighs any lost damage potential.",Strike/Suppression,,

vass_periodic_breaker,SHIP_SYSTEM,"A devastatingly powerful system, the Periodic Breaker accelerates the ship's timeflow to such an extent that time may as well be at a standstill for anything outside the device's sphere of influence.",Utility,Stops time.
,,,,,
vass_temporal_retreat,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Developed by Recipro scientists around cycle 87, the Temporal Retreat system can partially revert the ship's state a couple of seconds back in time. While not all aspects of the ship are completely reverted, things such as overall hull integrity and flux buildup are affected nearly in their entirety. Although the system doesn't 'generate' flux, as it reverts the flux state back in time, it still needs an available overhead to properly activate",Utility,Reverts the ship a couple of seconds back in time
,,,,,
vass_chrono_jump,SHIP_SYSTEM,"A very peculiar device developed by the comparatively recent Multa family, the Chrono Jump device uses poorly-understood timeline properties to effectively make an area of space 'jump' into a future state. While technically it is a lot more complicated, the end results are decently easy to understand. Equipped on the Curtana carrier to provide some much-needed defense against bomb and missile strikes, while also helping against other bursts of firepower.",Utility,Sends nearby projectiles forward in time. Activate to prime; re-activate to trigger
,,,,,
vass_temporal_recall,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Designed to minimize bomber downtime on the Estoc, the Temporal Recall allows its host vessel to revert its location relative to its carrier. This allows it to get back to rearm nearly instantly after dropping its payload, increasing both overall output of firepower and the survivability of its crew quite drastically.",Mobility,Brings the bomber back to its carrier after a short windup
,,,,,
vass_chrono_illusion,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Made almost as an advertisement rather than an actual combat system, the Chrono Illusion fulfills a similar role to flare launchers on more conventional fighters. However, its basis of operation is vastly different: by firing out tiny guided drones with installed Multa packets, the illusion of an entire fleet of almost-corporeal ships are created by visually overlapping several neighboring timelines for a couple of seconds. These can fool detectors working in nearly all spectra, though some scanners and targeting solutions might still be able to retain their target.",Defense,Creates visual clones that confuse most ship targeting
,,,,,
vass_isochronal_field,SHIP_SYSTEM,"A heavily modified derivative of the internal systems of the Fragarach, the Isochronal Field Emitter manipulates nearby timelines to pull or push projectiles between them. It can be used both for defensive and offensive purposes, depending on exactly how the system is configured. Due to the highly limited area in which a field can be maintained, works on a turret-mounted variant of the system have as of yet been unsuccessful.",Hybrid,Multiplies or deflects projectiles depending on mode

vass,FACTION,"Not one faction per se, the five Vass families are a series of crime syndicates with close cooperative ties. While often operating on rival terms and stepping on each other's toes, their aligned interests usually mean that they put up a united front against outside threats. These families are Accel, Torpor, Perturba, Recipro and Multa. All but Multa are pre-collapse organizations, and they all specialize in various forms of timeline-manipulating technology. This technology takes its peak in their 'Packets': portable one-use devices that can manipulate a person's timeflow for recreational purposes. While exorbitantly expensive, extremely harmful and highly illegal, there is always a rich clientelle in the sector for unique highs.

The five families defend their ships with unusual zeal: anyone who makes the mistake of stealing or recovering one of their ships are ruthlessly hunted down to keep the technologies stored within a secret. Despite this, most of their ships seem almost like bragging vessels: polished and decorated to an unnecessary extent for combat vessels, and built with luxury and comfort in mind.

The Vass are not technically the official term for the five families: rather, it refers to the shipyard they all cooperate with, Vass Shipyards. This secretive organization has reached near mythological status in the sector for their mysterious methods, contacts and products. They only sell to the five families, and no-one seems to know where their industrial center lies; some rumors claim it is outside the sector altogether, though the validity of these claims are questionable at best.",,,
