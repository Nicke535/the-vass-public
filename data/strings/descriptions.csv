vass_makhaira,SHIP,"Possibly the oldest of the ships still in production by Vass Shipyards, the Makhaira has been redisigned numerous times since its inception. The most recent model has been relegated to a supporting role in most of the families' fleets, either as combat support or as a smuggling vessel. Its unique shipsystem allows it to make much more risky manouvers than expected without running the risk of being punished.

Initially designed in a manner similar to a sport car, the Makhaira's external look actually hasn't changed much since its first version. The same, however, can't be said about the interior components. The first Makhaira designs are thought to outdate the Periodic Plating by at least a couple of decades by conservative estimates, and with the sole exception of the luxorious captain's quarters the entirety of the ships internal structure has been redesigned from scratch on multiple occasions.

The newest model in active production, sometimes nicknamed the Makhaira Reverter, started appearing in Vass fleets around cycle 90 post-collapse. The biggest addition over earlier designs is the Temporal Retreat system, which only finished prototyping a year or so earlier. Using some of the most recent inventions in macro-scale type-2 chrono reversion technology, this Recipro system can bring the ship 'back in time' a couple of seconds, undoing almost all effects or damage inflicted during this time. As the system's electronics takes up nearly twenty percent of the ship's volume, some smugglers within the Vass families still prefer the superior cargo capacity of older models. However, these are rarely if ever deployed as warships.

There are rumors about a new Makhaira model in the works, going under several varied names such as the Makhaira X, the Makhaira Penultimate and the Makhaira Multiplexer. However, no reliable details exist, and any information available is either simple myth or highly speculative in nature.",,,

vass_schiavona,SHIP,"As much a bragging right as a warship, the infamous Schiavona is the most mobile ship employed by the Vass families. Its fearsome Periodic Breaker system allows it to punch far above what its meager weapon loadout would imply.

Commonly used for hunter-killer duty, the ship is extremely fast and is capable of catching almost all known vessels both in- and out of a combat scenario unprepared. Accel in particular are known to use entire small fleets consisting of nothing but Schiavonas to hunt down those who cross them, earning it the nickname 'Lain's Bloodhound' in certain circles.

Of particular note is its Periodic Breaker system, often considered the most defining feature of the ship. The device accelerates the ship's timeflow to near-infinite levels, creating the illusion of time standing still for everything outside its sphere of influence. A side-effect of this is an extremely loud, almost tearing sound, which expands far outside the area directly affected by the system. In fact, for reasons still not entirely documented, this sound seems to travel without carrying mediums: it can be heard onboard other vessels despite being several kilometers away with nothing but the emptiness of space inbetween.",,,

# Weapons,,,,,

vass_dyrnwyn,WEAPON,"A simplistic but powerful weapon developed as a joint project between Accel and Perturba, the Dyrnwyn is effectively a highly customized Pulse Laser in a sleek housing. A miniature time accelerator is housed in the weapon which, while too power-heavy to activate normally, has been designed to run on the residual energy of nearby chrono-instabilities.

The Dyrnwyn is notable for lacking Torpor components, which is otherwise a staple in Vass engineering to protect from nearby timeline manipulation and distortion. Housing a device powered by such distortions meant this was not an option, so the weapon is instead built as rugged and durable as possible to avoid permanent damage. Despite this, however, the weapon is infamous among maintainance engineers for constantly recieving interior damage in ways nearly impossible to predict and needing constant supervision lest the device malfunctions in combat.",General,,

vass_cyllel_farchog,WEAPON,"The logical extreme of the Dyrnwyn blaster, the Cyllel Farchog can lay down a nothing short of terrifying wall of fire. Effectively six stripped-down Dyrnwyns with linked fire systems strapped into a temporally semi-stabilized casing, its main weaknesses is its low efficiency at dealing with spaceship armor and its poor accuracy.

Unlike the Dyrnwyn it is derived from the Cyllel Farchog does in fact use chrono-stabilizer components in most parts of the gun, with the main energy generation chamber being the notable exception. Being extremely cramped for space due to this, the gun barrels couldn't feasibly be pointed in the correct direction forcing the entire gun to be built around a comparatively crude electromagnet that redirects the ionized ordinance as it leaves the six barrels of the gun. This gives it lackluster accuracy, but its high rate-of-fire and the immense savings on maintainance are generally considered worth it.",General,,

vass_asi,WEAPON,"An attempt to weaponize the inertia-based oddities caused by time acceleration and deceleration, the Asi is a peculiar hybrid of a railgun, coilgun and particle accelerator. Shifting between slowing down time and speeding up time, it can fire a metal slug at speeds enough to practically evaporate on contact, giving it a damage profile more akin to an explosive.

While a railgun is normally limited in its speed by how long the barrel is and the strength of its magnets, the unique effects of time acceleration and deceleration changes the playing field entirely. Decelerating the projectile's timeflow during the acceleration phase of the weapon, and then swiftly 'switching polarities' on the device to vastly accelerate the timeflow means that the slug has more time to accelerate down the barrel, while still getting a much higher barrel velocity than conventional weapons of comparable size.

The weapon would be considered nothing short of revolutionizing in the field of warfare were it not for its exorbitant price and the fact that it's nearly impossible to upscale. In fact, the various temporal mechanics required for its operation without an exponentially higher energy cost only align properly at two known sizes: one being the size used on the Asi, and the other being on the nanometer scale.",General,,

vass_yawarakai_te,WEAPON,"A strange mix of laser refractor and chrono-destabilizer, the Yawaratai-Te is one of the more unique point-defense solutions in the sector. While the instabilities generated by it are too weak to actually destroy incoming ordinance, it gives a very good chance of leaving them inert and harmless.

The Yawaratai-Te was initially a test bed for a beam-carried chronoinstability weapon. However, the beam itself was distorted too much to maintain cohesion at any longer ranges, and the damage resulting from the weapon was much less than initially expected. After almost thirty years with no notable progress, the entire project was scrapped and funding was pulled. The hundred or so prototypes that remained were shipped off to a remote facility in the Persean sector to be hidden away, in case new technology in the field appeared sometime in the future.

The story of the weapon would most likely have ended there, had it not been for the Fall. With the Persean sector now destabilized and violent, the Perturba faced problems they never had to deal with before. Notably, almost all Perturba ships were outfitted for minor skirmishes at most, and completely lacked defenses against the military-grade missiles that now saturated the sector. Scrambling for a solution that didn't rely on external weapon manufacturers, the old prototypes for the Yawaratai-Te were rediscovered. The lackluster damage profile was tweaked to allow it to hurt guidance and arming mechanisms in missiles, and new refractory lenses were mounted to allow the weapon to be placed in a fixed casing but still aim at incoming ordinance near-instantanously. While beam cohesion never was solved, its effects were mitigated by simply using more beam emitters at once. This also had the bonus of allowing multiple missiles to be targeted at once, albeit at reduced power.",Missile Defense,,

vass_caladbolg,WEAPON,"A cannon with such an oversized bore that it has no right fitting in a medium mount, the Caladbolg relies on a novel chrono-reversal mechanism to load new (or rather, old) shells back into its chamber. An unfortunate consequence of this is a lowered firerate at long ranges.

Mostly a tech demo in compact chrono-reversal technology, the shells of the Caladbolg are to-date the smallest such devices in widespread use. While prototype 'ejection seats' of sorts have been created that are technically smaller, they are still prohibitively expensive even by Vass standards and thus only in use by a select few individuals. That's not to say the Caladbolg's shells are a cheap piece of technology; they are still expensive enough to rival that of the cannon it's fired out of.

Said cannon is actually surprisingly simple: a (relatively) simple timeflow-stabilized tracking device for the shells to home in on, a system for injecting and igniting propellant, and solid rifled barrel with a slide-mechanism breach. The breach is mostly used to disperse any unignited propellant and to ensure the chrono-reversal process can be undergone without risk of jamming the barrel. Early prototypes without this breach mechanism tended to have the shot reverted a degree or so off from the original state, causing shots to get stuck in the barrel on ignition and subsequently destroy the entire weapon from the inside out.",Assault,,

vass_fragarach,WEAPON,"One of the very few cases of weaponized multi-timeline manipulation, the Fragarach can hit targets it by all rights should have missed by 'grazing' nearby timelines. It is primarily a weapon for knocking out shields, but can be used quite effectively as a PD solution as well.

The Fragarach is the Multa family's first (succesful) attempt at weapons manufacture. At its core, it is a coilgun with an intentionally bad barrel stabilization and circuits that are extremely prone to react to instablities in the ship's flux grid. What this means is that even extremely small changes when firing, almost down to the atomic level, can cascade into a wildly different exit angle for the projectile. While these aspects might appear to be massive flaws to any conventional weapon, they are absolutely critical for the Fragarach.

One of the core issues with timeline-grazing technology is that timelines that interact must be 'close' to eachother. What exactly this 'closeness' entails is a hotly debated subject, but one of the most generally accepted theories is that two timelines are close if their causes are close; that is to say, the smaller the differing 'events' between the timelines, the closer they are. This is exploited to the extreme in the Fragarach, as individual quantum effects can cause the weapon to miss by several degrees and seemingly at random. This means that while the different timelines of the projectile are far away 'geometrically', they are somehow still close 'chronically', allowing the weapon's effects to be considerably more far-reaching than a normal coilgun fielding the technology would be.",Assault/PD,,
