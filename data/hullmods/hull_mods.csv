Periodic Plating,vass_periodic_plating,2,,,unique,Unique,9999,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.scripts.hullmods.VassPeriodicPlating,"Vass ships utilize a special low-grade time disruption unit on all their ships to bolster combat performance. This effectively causes time to pass %s faster for all Vass ships in combat.

The technology has its limitations, however. The time-accelerating properties of the Periodic Plating are incredibly sensitive, meaning that it cannot be used at the same time as the ship system, when the ship is venting flux or when the ship is overloading.",Time passes faster for this vessel.,graphics/vass/hullmods/vass_periodic_plating.png

This powerful device is impractical in a combat scenario, but its value in getting a ship quickly in and out of combat areas should not be underestimated.",Enters combat extremely quickly.,graphics/vass/hullmods/vass_advanced_entrance_module.png
Swiftlaunch Fighter Bays,vass_swiftlaunch_bays,2,,,unique,Unique,9999,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.scripts.hullmods.VassSwiftlaunchBays,"An answer to the sub-par fighter control protocols employed by the Vass, the Swiftlaunch system allows quick redeployment of strike craft to constantly keep the pressure up despite lacking in pure fighter count.

The ship %s of each fighter ready for deployment: any time losses are taken, the ship %s. The ship repairs these bonus fighters only when all fighters in a wing are intact. Repair speed is affected by replacement rate as usual, but is only %s for the bonus fighters due to the complications of constructing and repairing fighters while they are launch-ready.

In addition, all fighters that suffer critical hull damage are %s for repairs rather than being destroyed in the field.",Has backup fighters ready to deploy when needed.,graphics/vass/hullmods/swiftlaunch_bays_2.png
