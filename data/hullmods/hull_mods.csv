Chronostabilized Reactor,vass_chronostabilized_reactor,TRUE,7,15,23,0,data.scripts.hullmods.VassChronostabilizedReactor,"Using some of the most powerful reactor technologies available to the Vass, this ship recieves special bonuses when using its ship system:

During Chrono Disturber, flux dissipation is increased by 30 percent
During Time Haven, flux dissipates unaffected by the time slow
During Periodic Breaker, flux can be dissipated at 50 percent of the normal rate
During Isochronal Multilinker, flux dissipation is increased by 400 percent",graphics/vass/hullmods/vass_chronostabilized_reactor.png

During Chrono Disturber, max speed, acceleration and turn rates are increased by 30 percent
During Time Haven, it enables the ship to move normally
During Periodic Breaker, max speed is increased by 150 percent

Vass EX Reactor,vass_experimental_reactor,TRUE,10,20,30,0,data.scripts.hullmods.VassExperimentalReactor,"An experimental reactor which overcharges Vass systems, giving them immense power but making them prone to failure:

During Chrono Disturber, Increase the maximum time slow to 60 percent, but causes it to slow the using ship for 25 percent
During Time Haven, all flux is removed when the effect ends. However, all weapons have a chance to break when using the system, with the risk increasing with flux level
During Periodic Breaker, the ship has practically infinite max flux, however it overloads if it has more than its normal maximum when the effect ends
Isochronal Multilinker causes the ship to momentarily drop its shields, but gives twice as much charge",graphics/vass/hullmods/vass_experimental_reactor.png

Periodic Plating,vass_periodic_plating,FALSE,0,0,0,0,data.scripts.hullmods.VassPeriodicPlating,"Vass ships utilize a special low-grade time disruption unit on all their ships. This effectively causes time to pass 20 percent faster for Vass ships in combat.

The technology has its limitations, however. The time-accelerating properties of the Periodic Plating is incredibly sensitive, meaning that it cannot be used at the same time as the ship system, when the ship is venting flux or when the ship is overloading.",graphics/vass/hullmods/vass_periodic_plating.png
Fauchard Timelock Mod,vass_fauchard_timelock_modification,FALSE,0,0,0,0,data.scripts.hullmods.VassFauchardTimelockModification,"Developed by Torpor, these special modifications and time-locking fields are installed on all Zhanmadao-class cruisers. They allow the ships Fauchard Beams to lock an enemy ship's flux in time, making it much harder to remove.

The end result is that one fourth of the damage dealt by the ship's Fauchard Beams also adds hard flux, as long as the weapon hits the enemy's shield (this includes Spinal Fauchard Beams, and the amount cannot be increased by damage-increasing effects).",graphics/vass/hullmods/vass_fauchard_timelock_modification.png
