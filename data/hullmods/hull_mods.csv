Periodic Plating,vass_periodic_plating,2,,,special,Special,9999,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.scripts.hullmods.VassPeriodicPlating,"Vass ships utilize a special low-grade time disruption unit on all their ships to bolster combat performance. This effectively causes time to pass 20 percent faster for all Vass ships in combat.

The technology has its limitations, however. The time-accelerating properties of the Periodic Plating are incredibly sensitive, meaning that it cannot be used at the same time as the ship system, when the ship is venting flux or when the ship is overloading.",Time passes faster for this vessel.,graphics/vass/hullmods/vass_periodic_plating.png

This powerful device is impractical in a combat scenario, but its value in getting a ship quickly in and out of combat areas should not be underestimated.",Enters combat extremely quickly.,graphics/vass/hullmods/vass_advanced_entrance_module.png
