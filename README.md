# the-vass-public
This is the public repository for the Vass Starsector mod. A (mostly) complete changelog can be found in changelog.txt, or in the project's commit history. The master branch is the only one guaranteed to run: other branches are not yet publicly released or ready for use.

  * Gwyvern, for making effectively all sprites in the mod and the occasional script
  * MesoTronik, for various scripting assistance, sound making and other tidbits
  * Nia, for some scripts
  * Alex Mosolov, because of course I'm using some vanilla stuff in the mod!
  * Psiyon, for minor script pieces

SFX:  
  * eflexthesounddesigner - artillery shell  
  * edo333 - sci-fi sniper  
  * gregsmedia - gunshot  
  * wildweasel - dual neutron disruptor  
  * Kueller - "The World" sound/Timestop sound
