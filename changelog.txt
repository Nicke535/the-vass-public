Version 0.4 : Time for another sprite rework
 Additions:
  - Added a second Frigate, the Akrafena, with a new shipsystem
  - Added a new Perturba event allowing you to get legitimate access to their ships once your relations are high enough
  - Started implementing the as-of-yet hidden Family Power mechanic with som of the player's actions
     > Currently does nothing notable and can't be seen in-game: that will change later
  - Started implementing the four other families' Elite bonuses
     > Still not available in the campaign, but there are some test missions allowing you to get a preview of what to expect

 Graphics:
  - Updated all ship sprites, courtesy of Gwyvern
    > For, what, the third time? Though these ones are definitely the best yet!

 Changes:
  - The Perturba Weapon Testing quest now tracks an arbitrary "progress" value rather than number of battles.
     > Experimental change. The end result of this change is that the quest is slower (around 5-6 battles needed) when just deploying the ship and not using it in combat, but shorter when actually allowing it to fight (down to 2 missions needed if you use it actively a lot and/or use it in stressing situations)
  - The Perturba Weapon Testing quest now increases relations (both Vass and Perturba) slightly more
  - Minor visual changes in refit screens for Vass ships
  - Multa elites now have adjusted passive colors, which are slightly less spaztic
     > They still don't spawn anywhere but through cheats, though
  - The Tiandong and Anarakis Reparations Society (if enabled) can now steal Vass ships in their random encounters, like the Independent and Pirates
  - If the Templars are enabled, Vass fleets will no longer suicidally spawn to engage them

 Balance:
  - Curtana:
     -- Gained a new Small mount
     -- OP up from 135 to 145
     -- Rearranged mount types slightly
     -- Dissipation up from 380 to 500
         > Oversight originally, it was never meant to have this low dissipation. Might be an overbuff now, but will have to see
     -- System recieved slightly tweaked AI and now "punts" projectiles slightly further into the future
     -- Swiftlaunch Bays now refill up to 95% of the refit time of a returning fighter, instead of up to 80%   
         > Used to be 65% flat, 15% based on hull level. Now 70% flat, 25% based on hulllevel
     -- Swiftlaunch Bays are now slightly more aggressive with recalling its fighters when they are damaged
     -- Fleet point cost down from 24 FP to 19 FP
     -- Supplies/month down from 29 to 24
    > I also minorly reworked all Curtana variants due to the abovementioned changes
  - Schiavona:
     -- Now has a frontal small turret instead of a rear small turret.
     -- Fleet point cost down from 21 FP to 16 FP
     -- Supplies/month down from 22 to 19
  - Makhaira:
     -- Recieved a pair of built-in Yawarakai-Te variants, the Juuchi Yosamu
     -- Maximum crew capacity up from 12 to 16
     -- Fleet point cost down from 7 FP to 6 FP
     -- Supplies/month down from 8 to 7
  - Katzbalger:
     -- The Chrono Illusion system now spawns more illusions, and the illusions have more health
     -- Armor increased from 60 to 80
  - All Perturba missile weapons (Tizona, Colada, Excalibur) damage and EMP increased by ~30%
     > These were underperforming across the board, so it was about time they got a bit of love

 Bugfixes:
  - The Perturba Weapon Contract event is no longer bugged, and will properly show the dialogue it is meant to
     > It had issues showing around half of the intended dialogue; *whoops*
  - The Perturba Weapon Testing event now displays the proper exit dialogue
  - The Perturba Weapon Testing quest can now only raise your relations to Friendly, not Cooperative
  - The Perturba Weapon Testing quest now properly displays its relations-increase (it was 7, not 0.07 as shown)
  - You may now only ever have a single Perturba quest active at a time (including future quests): to get a new quest, either finish or quit your current one
  - Temporal Retreat no longer sneakily forgets to revert the top- and bottom-most armor grid rows
  - Fixed potential campaign bug allowing Vass fleets to spawn too close to the player if they had extreme sensor profiles
  - Fixed bug where ending Perturba's weapon contract would remove blueprint knowledge of their weapons even if gotten from other sources than the event (should rarely happen, but was possible)
     > Should rarely have happened, but was possible
  - Fixed a bug where Perturba's weapon contract event did not properly give access to the Tizona
     > How did I miss this for this long?

 Other:
  - Some minor performance improvements here and there
  - Typo fixes
     > Frankly, more than I like to admit


Version 0.3.3 : Time for some shaders
 General:
  - Added GraphicsLib support for normal maps on ships and [most] weapons
  - Added GraphicsLib light support for some guns and effects
  - Made Yawarakai Te FX fade out faster if the player is firing it while under influence (timeflow influence, that is)

 Balance:
  - Made Perturba Weapon Testing missions more profitable, and improved the relations bonus gotten from them

 Bugfixes:
  - You can no longer start a Weapon Testing event while already performing one
  - Fixed bug causing partially-fitted carriers to occassionally bug out the first Vass encounter
  - Fixed display bug for the Perturba version of the Vass hullmod (as of yet mission-exclusive)


Version 0.3.2d
 General:
  - Vass fleets should no longer hunt any mission-critical targets, including person bounties
     > This checks for a vanilla flag, so if you encounter a mod this still happens with, tell me

 Balance:
  - Makhaira:
     * Cargo space from 10 -> 24
     * Fuel from 20 -> 18
        > It's a smuggling ship, after all.
  - Schiavona:
     * Cargo space from 80 -> 60
     * Fuel from 80 -> 70
        > It's not a smuggling ship, after all.
  - Yawarakai-Te:
     * DPS from 170 -> 210

 Bugfix:
  - Fixed missing memory key in the weapon-contract event preventing you from ever getting the weapon-testing event
     > I also included a new Console Command to fix this for anyone who has already taken the weapon-contract event: just do the command "VassMeetPerturbaContact" and you're good to go


Version 0.3.2c
 Bugfix:
  - Removed the no-autofit tag from Vass ships, as it caused issues with custom orders and some modded hullmods
  - Ensured prototypes do not drop from most "mundane" sources
  - Fixed a bug causing Yawarakai-Te weapons use more flux than intended when firing without a target
  - Made the "clean up all data" console command... actually clean all data. Or, well, all I've found.


Version 0.3.2b
 Bugfix:
  - Removed massive debug logs spawning all the time
     > How did I miss this, now again?


Version 0.3.2a
 General:
  - Made Vass punishment fleets considerably more common at low Vass Power, and slightly more common at high ones
  - Increased spawn delay for Vass Punishment fleets slightly
  - Stopped the Vass from attempting to extort battlestations

 Bugfixes:
  - Fixed the Perturba Weapon Testing event not being finishable
  - The Debug flag is no longer enabled for the Perturba Weapon Testing event; it should no longer appear all the time regardless of condition
  - Fixed the intel description for the Perturba Weapon Testing event
  - Fixed Perturba Prototypes auto-disabling themselves in combat at times
  - Fixed Perturba Prototypes having more target leading issues than intended
     > This quest was quite broken on release! I'm sorry for that, hopefully the big issues are now fixed
  



Version 0.3.2: Time for a new quest
 General:
  - Added a new repeatable quest for Perturba after you've met their contact
	> This one's almost my favorite addition, and has some interesting mechanics behind it. There'll be more additions to it later
  - Added basic faction description
  - Updated some text for the initial Perturba quest
  - Added a pair of Command Console commands for manipulating Vass standing and resetting the mod practically back to square 1
	> Mostly in case people want to change their approach between patches without needing an entirely new savefile. Use at own risk, though, it's not 100% stable in all situations
  - Added the Tizona Emitter, the first missile weapon of the families
  - Adjusted Chrono Jump visuals
	> No more particles, viva la trail!
  - Vass punishment fleets will now take a day or so before arriving, instead of instantly popping up the second you steal something
  - Slightly adjusted visuals and timing of the Asi, and gave it a new sound courtesy of MesoTroniK
  - Gave the Caladbolg a new sound courtesy of MesoTroniK


 Balance:
  - Fragarach Chronostimulus
     * damage per shot 530 -> 510
        > Minor nerf, wasn't really outrageously good in any way but always a solid PD pick. Might've been an unnecessary nerf honestly

  - Cyllel Farchog Array:
     * spread pattern slightly altered, more centered
     * flux per shot 75 -> 67
	> The poor Cyllel suffers from excessive flux and wierd spreading. This hopefully remedies that slightly

  - Estoc
     * weapon damage 1000x3 -> 700x3
     * weapon EMP 750x3 -> 525x3
     * deployment range 6000 -> 4000
     * flux capacity 800 -> 600
     * slightly improved engine performance: should have less issues firing its bombs now
        > Range and damage was just an oversight, it wasn't ever meant to be that high. Durability was a tad bit high when paired with the Curtana; the synergy is nice, but maybe a bit TOO nice. Engine performance changes mostly for AI benefit; not sure how much it actually contributed but it is worth a shot and seems to give minor improvements for me

  - Katzbalger
     * deployment range 6000 -> 4000
        > Same range oversight here


 Bugfixes:
  - Fixed some issues with the initial Vass encounter such as fighers not being taken and issues with fleet interception
  - The Baselard and Tuck should no longer incorrectly appear in various places
  - Safety Overrides no longer kills your crew in simulations
	> Oops.
  - Added Vass ships to Prism blacklist
  - Various fixes to the Colada Emitter
  - Vass fleets don't spawn against other factions nearly as excessively, now




Version 0.3.1c
 Bugfixes:
  - Removed crash error that sometimes appear when entering the refit screen


Version 0.3.1b
 General
  - Made Vass fleets no longer try and extort Remnant and Derelict fleetsm because that's silly
  - Made the Combat Carrier Curtana variant slightly less shit
  - Fixed minor spelling errors

 Bugfixes:
  - Hopefully made WIP fighters not spawn in prism freeport
  - Fixed spelling error causing the initial Perturba quest to never appear
  

Version 0.3.1a
 General:
  - Fixed color for design types
  - Changed color for weapon covers
  - Made initial bar quest twice as likely to appear
  - Added a pair of randomized missions that feature normal Vass fleets rather than Perturba Elites
  - Changed mission icons (still pretty much placeholder, though)
  - Added some minor forward-compatibility improvements

 Balance:
  - Colada Emitter: 
     * tripled shots/burst (this was just bugged, really)

 Bugfixes:
  - The Perturba initial quest can now appear on any player market if they have ship-production capabilities, not just the market WITH ship production


Version 0.3.1 : Time for a small update
 General:
  - Added most missing descriptions

 Balance:
  - Dyrnwyn blaster: 
     * flux per shot 70 -> 80
     * Damage per shot 65 -> 80
  - Cyllel Farchog Array:
     * flux per shot 65 -> 75
     * Damage per shot 65 -> 80
  - Yawarakai-Te:
     * Damage/sec 140 -> 170
     * Range 350 -> 400 ["effective" range of 250 unchanged: this is to give Perturba Elites more use of their +150 effective range]
  - Caladbolg Bombard:
     * Accuracy slightly improved

 Bugfixes:
  - The Perturba initial quest no longer freezes by doing certain dialogue actions
  - Added missing weapon to the initial Perturba quest


Version 0.3 : Time to start anew
 - Entire mod effectively rebuilt to work better and to support new mechanics
