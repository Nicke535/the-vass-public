Version 0.3.X
 Bugfix:
  - Removed the no-autofit tag from Vass ships, as it caused issues with custom orders and some modded hullmods
  - Ensured prototypes do not drop from most "mundane" sources
  - Fixed a bug causing Yawarakai-Te weapons use more flux than intended when firing without a target


Version 0.3.2b
 Bugfix:
  - Removed massive debug logs spawning all the time
     > How did I miss this, now again?


Version 0.3.2a
 General:
  - Made Vass punishment fleets considerably more common at low Vass Power, and slightly more common at high ones
  - Increased spawn delay for Vass Punishment fleets slightly
  - Stopped the Vass from attempting to extort battlestations

 Bugfixes:
  - Fixed the Perturba Weapon Testing event not being finishable
  - The Debug flag is no longer enabled for the Perturba Weapon Testing event; it should no longer appear all the time regardless of condition
  - Fixed the intel description for the Perturba Weapon Testing event
  - Fixed Perturba Prototypes auto-disabling themselves in combat at times
  - Fixed Perturba Prototypes having more target leading issues than intended
     > This quest was quite broken on release! I'm sorry for that, hopefully the big issues are now fixed
  



Version 0.3.2: Time for a new quest
 General:
  - Added a new repeatable quest for Perturba after you've met their contact
	> This one's almost my favorite addition, and has some interesting mechanics behind it. There'll be more additions to it later
  - Added basic faction description
  - Updated some text for the initial Perturba quest
  - Added a pair of Command Console commands for manipulating Vass standing and resetting the mod practically back to square 1
	> Mostly in case people want to change their approach between patches without needing an entirely new savefile. Use at own risk, though, it's not 100% stable in all situations
  - Added the Tizona Emitter, the first missile weapon of the families
  - Adjusted Chrono Jump visuals
	> No more particles, viva la trail!
  - Vass punishment fleets will now take a day or so before arriving, instead of instantly popping up the second you steal something
  - Slightly adjusted visuals and timing of the Asi, and gave it a new sound courtesy of MesoTroniK
  - Gave the Caladbolg a new sound courtesy of MesoTroniK


 Balance:
  - Fragarach Chronostimulus
     * damage per shot 530 -> 510
        > Minor nerf, wasn't really outrageously good in any way but always a solid PD pick. Might've been an unnecessary nerf honestly

  - Cyllel Farchog Array:
     * spread pattern slightly altered, more centered
     * flux per shot 75 -> 67
	> The poor Cyllel suffers from excessive flux and wierd spreading. This hopefully remedies that slightly

  - Estoc
     * weapon damage 1000x3 -> 700x3
     * weapon EMP 750x3 -> 525x3
     * deployment range 6000 -> 4000
     * flux capacity 800 -> 600
     * slightly improved engine performance: should have less issues firing its bombs now
        > Range and damage was just an oversight, it wasn't ever meant to be that high. Durability was a tad bit high when paired with the Curtana; the synergy is nice, but maybe a bit TOO nice. Engine performance changes mostly for AI benefit; not sure how much it actually contributed but it is worth a shot and seems to give minor improvements for me

  - Katzbalger
     * deployment range 6000 -> 4000
        > Same range oversight here


 Bugfixes:
  - Fixed some issues with the initial Vass encounter such as fighers not being taken and issues with fleet interception
  - The Baselard and Tuck should no longer incorrectly appear in various places
  - Safety Overrides no longer kills your crew in simulations
	> Oops.
  - Added Vass ships to Prism blacklist
  - Various fixes to the Colada Emitter
  - Vass fleets don't spawn against other factions nearly as excessively, now




Version 0.3.1c
 Bugfixes:
  - Removed crash error that sometimes appear when entering the refit screen


Version 0.3.1b
 General
  - Made Vass fleets no longer try and extort Remnant and Derelict fleetsm because that's silly
  - Made the Combat Carrier Curtana variant slightly less shit
  - Fixed minor spelling errors

 Bugfixes:
  - Hopefully made WIP fighters not spawn in prism freeport
  - Fixed spelling error causing the initial Perturba quest to never appear
  

Version 0.3.1a
 General:
  - Fixed color for design types
  - Changed color for weapon covers
  - Made initial bar quest twice as likely to appear
  - Added a pair of randomized missions that feature normal Vass fleets rather than Perturba Elites
  - Changed mission icons (still pretty much placeholder, though)
  - Added some minor forward-compatibility improvements

 Balance:
  - Colada Emitter: 
     * tripled shots/burst (this was just bugged, really)

 Bugfixes:
  - The Perturba initial quest can now appear on any player market if they have ship-production capabilities, not just the market WITH ship production


Version 0.3.1 : Time for a small update
 General:
  - Added most missing descriptions

 Balance:
  - Dyrnwyn blaster: 
     * flux per shot 70 -> 80
     * Damage per shot 65 -> 80
  - Cyllel Farchog Array:
     * flux per shot 65 -> 75
     * Damage per shot 65 -> 80
  - Yawarakai-Te:
     * Damage/sec 140 -> 170
     * Range 350 -> 400 ["effective" range of 250 unchanged: this is to give Perturba Elites more use of their +150 effective range]
  - Caladbolg Bombard:
     * Accuracy slightly improved

 Bugfixes:
  - The Perturba initial quest no longer freezes by doing certain dialogue actions
  - Added missing weapon to the initial Perturba quest


Version 0.3 : Time to start anew
 - Entire mod effectively rebuilt to work better and to support new mechanics
 - Too many changes to track for now
