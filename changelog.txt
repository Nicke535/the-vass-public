Version 0.4.2a
 Bugfixes:
  - Fixed fatal error when the autofire AI picker runs for weapons with null-valued weapon specifications



Version 0.4.2 : Time for new beginnings
 Additions:
  - When playing Nexerelin, there are now 2 Vass-themed starting options: one with you already being Family member and an elite ship, while the other one starts you with a small Vass fleet and means to get more
  - Added a console command (if using the Console Commands mod) for spawning a Vass ship submarket on Asharu and getting permission to own Vass ships
     > This is meant as a "quick start cheat" in non-nexerelin for those people who want to use Vass ships but don't want to handle the current campaign questline
  - The Yawarakai Te now has custom autofire AI taking the weapon's arc into consideration, reducing the amount of unnecessary firing

 Changes:
  - Perturba Submarket now requires you to have at least Welcoming relations
     > This is mostly to facilitate the new starting options in Nex and the console command, but it also avoids a rare case where you are allowed to purchase from the submarket, BUT not actually allowed to own the ships afterwards...
  - Perturba Submarket now has a wider spread of D-mod count (though ships will always have at least 1 D-mod)
  - Altered some variants to not have left-over OP

 Balance:
  - Makhaira
     -- Cargo space from 24 -> 65
     -- Fuel storage from 18 -> 40
     -- Min crew from 12 -> 10
     -- Max crew from 16 -> 24
     > Not sure how this was missed for so long, but the Makhaira had *awful* supply stats, given that it is supposedly a smuggling vessel and the main support ship of the Vass fleets. While still inferior point-for-point to the Hound, this brings it closer in line with what could be expected of a smuggling vessel.

  - Curtana
     -- Min crew from 140 -> 120
     -- Max crew from 180 -> 210
     > Not as blatant as the Makhaira, but the Custana still had tighter-than-intended logistics profile, with very tight crew space overhead and surprisingly high crew usage for being designed as a low-crew carrier.

  - Akrafena
     -- Fuel/ly from 1.5 -> 1
     -- Min crew from 20 -> 13
     -- Max crew from 21 -> 20
     > I'm convinced some of these were just incorrectly copied fields, frankly.

  - Schiavona
     -- Fuel storage from 70 -> 80

 Bugfixes:
  - Fixed a truly *ancient* bug which occassionally caused issues with order-of-executions occassionally rendering the percieved time mult incorrect for multiple Vass ships in a combat
     > This may have impacts on how the ships feel in handling/gameplay (since time mult was percieved incorrectly in many situations), so feedback on this is much appreciated
  - Fixed incorrect rules.csv setup (again...) causing issues when performing the new Arms Dealer event with an existing contact
  - Fixed Prism Freeport (if enabled by other mods) occassionally selling the Akrafena, Baselard and Tuck
     > The Baselard and Tuck are not fully implemented and should thus not be obtainable at all
  - Hopefully fixed a bug where the Yawarakai Te and its derivatives gave the wrong flux cost when no missiles were in range
  - Yawarakai Te and its derivatives now correctly identify and ignores flares when using IPDAI
  - The Isochronal Field (Akrafena) system redirection cooldown is now affected by the System Experise skill (and any other shipsystem cooldown modifiers)



Version 0.4.1c
 Bugfixes:
  - Fixed bug causing hard-crash due to incorrect rules.csv fields
  - Fixed bug causing hard-crash when accessing the new Arms Dealer variation on an old savefile



Version 0.4.1b
 Additions:
  - Added a new variation on the Arms Dealer event, which favors expensive equipment and allows you to procure otherwise-restricted Vass equipment
 
 Changes:
  - Vass ships and fighters can no longer be purchased from normal Arms Dealer events
     > See the event above for the new mechanic
  - Minor adjustments to Vass fleet interception, should be somewhat more reliable now
  - Vass relations are no longer synced to commission if playing with Nexerelin
  - Various minor improvements have been made to some campaign interactions, mainly in the text-styling department

 Bugfixes:
  - Fixed unknown bug caused by the Chrono Jump system moving a BALLISTIC_AS_BEAM projectile entity which is not a DamagingProjectileAPI entity
     > Yes, that should be an oxymoron. No, I haven't been able to find what weapon causes this.
  - Minor typo fixes in fleet events



Version 0.4.1a
 Changes:
  - Slightly altered Curtana codex text
     > The previous description referenced no-longer-existant ship design features
  - Updated a few ship variants to better match intended roles and be up-to-date with hullmod changes

 Bugfixes:
  - Fixed major bug causing initial Vass mission fleet to regularly miss the player and despawn, often without being noticed
     > Oops.
  - Fixed Tizona typo (thanks TameFroggy!)
  - Fixed Schiavona typo
  - Fixed the Yawarakai Te and Juuchi Yosamu not correctly applying certain damage increases
  - Fixed Vass ship variants not being tagged as goal variants



Version 0.4.1: It's about time
 Additions:
  - Added normal maps (for GraphicsLib) for all weapons that were lacking them (such as the Caladbolg and Perturba prototypes)
  - Added GraphicsLib light sources for all applicable weapons and effects
  - Added XP gain to certain campaign events, as appropriate
     > I don't know what reasonable XP gains is. Feedback on if these are excessively high or low is always appreciated!

 Balance:
  - Schiavona
     -- Base burn down from 10 to 9
     -- Now comes with built-in Augmented Drive Field
     > This puts the "maximum" performance of the Schiavona's speed in-line with many other destroyers while still firmly establishing it as a pursuit ship
  - Tizona/Colada Emitter:
     -- Flux/Shot down from 75 to 45
     -- Damage up from 400 to 450
     -- EMP up from 300 to 450
     > The Tizona and Colada always felt a bit enemic, especially when compared to weapons such as the Annihilator. A bigger rework may be needed, but this should work as a stop-gap
  - Estoc:
     -- Weapon EMP up from 675 to 900
         > Mostly to bring it in-line with the Tizona and Colada Damage/EMP distribution

 Bugfixes:
  - Fixed compatibility with newest version of Starsector (0.96a-RC7) and MagicLib
  - Fixed several bugs related to the early-game Perturba campaign content
  - Fixed certain campaign-unique items showing up in mission refit
     > They never *functioned* outside the campaign anyhow
  - Fixed an exploit where the Vass families sometimes did not detect massive sales of fighters, as long as no ships were sold
     > You can still avoid scrutiny the intended way: by selling them piecemeal over prolonged time
  - Fixed some typos



Version 0.4c
 Additions:
  - Added cross-mod compatibility configurations to the Isochronal Field system: see the file data/config/modSettings.json
     > Contains a blacklist and a "whitelist"[see the file]: mod makers should take a look there and add their projectiles if necessary

 Changes:
  - Made a small adjustment to Perturba Weapon Testing's intel text clarifying that a ship which is destroyed usually doesn't help further the quest progress
     > "It's a feature."

 Bugfixes:
  - The Perturba weapon testing event now needs 100% progress to be completed, instead of 3%
  - Fixed perturba ship purchase event having a 9000% too high chance of spawning in a bar
     > Note that this only affects how likely the event was to push out other events in a bar: it is still just as likely to push out another Vass event, so you should be encountering it about as often as long as you pick it up as soon as it came available. This was mostly just an issue where if you ignored the event it would haunt you quite a bit...
  - Fixed issue with visuals de-syncing if more than one ship with the Isochronal Field system were deployed at once...
     > HOW did I not catch this earlier?
  - Implemented fixes for the Isochronal Field system, disallowing most projectile-splitting weapons to work unless whitelisted
     > This is necessary to prevent infinite loop possibilities


Version 0.4b
 Bugfixes:
  - Fixed a bug that could permanently brick a save under specific circumstances
     > *WHOOPS*.
  - Minor fix for the event-based sound effect added last version


Version 0.4a
 Changes:
  - Made the "A Profitable Partnership" intel get pinned as important by default
  - Added a sound effect to a... certain event... in the event where you meet the Perturba contact.

 Bugfixes:
  - Fixed a bug where "A profitable Partnership" would sometimes not properly register memory flags and soft-locked the mod's progression
     > To fix a soft-locked savegame, if you have "A profitable Partnership", run the console command "VassMeetPerturbaContact". If you don't have that intel, this should not affect you
  - Hopefully fixed a bug where Vass fleets would continue chasing you while they were trying to leave you alone
  - Fixed a bug where campaign-side engines displayed incorrectly on the Schiavona


Version 0.4 : Time for another sprite rework
 Additions:
  - Added a second Frigate, the Akrafena, with a new shipsystem
  - Added a new Perturba event allowing you to get legitimate access to their ships once your relations are high enough
  - Started implementing the as-of-yet hidden Family Power mechanic with som of the player's actions
     > Currently does nothing notable and can't be seen in-game: that will change later
  - Started implementing the four other families' Elite bonuses
     > Still not available in the campaign, but there are some test missions allowing you to get a preview of what to expect

 Graphics:
  - Updated all ship sprites, courtesy of Gwyvern
    > For, what, the third time? Though these ones are definitely the best yet!

 Changes:
  - The Perturba Weapon Testing quest now tracks an arbitrary "progress" value rather than number of battles.
     > Experimental change. The end result of this change is that the quest is slower (around 5-6 battles needed) when just deploying the ship and not using it in combat, but shorter when actually allowing it to fight (down to 2 missions needed if you use it actively a lot and/or use it in stressing situations)
  - The Perturba Weapon Testing quest now increases relations (both Vass and Perturba) slightly more
  - Minor visual changes in refit screens for Vass ships
  - Multa elites now have adjusted passive colors, which are slightly less spaztic
     > They still don't spawn anywhere but through cheats, though
  - The Tiandong and Anarakis Reparations Society (if enabled) can now steal Vass ships in their random encounters, like the Independent and Pirates
  - If the Templars are enabled, Vass fleets will no longer suicidally spawn to engage them

 Balance:
  - Curtana:
     -- Gained a new Small mount
     -- OP up from 135 to 145
     -- Rearranged mount types slightly
     -- Dissipation up from 380 to 500
         > Oversight originally, it was never meant to have this low dissipation. Might be an overbuff now, but will have to see
     -- System recieved slightly tweaked AI and now "punts" projectiles slightly further into the future
     -- Swiftlaunch Bays now refill up to 95% of the refit time of a returning fighter, instead of up to 80%   
         > Used to be 65% flat, 15% based on hull level. Now 70% flat, 25% based on hulllevel
     -- Swiftlaunch Bays are now slightly more aggressive with recalling its fighters when they are damaged
     -- Fleet point cost down from 24 FP to 19 FP
     -- Supplies/month down from 29 to 24
    > I also minorly reworked all Curtana variants due to the abovementioned changes
  - Schiavona:
     -- Now has a frontal small turret instead of a rear small turret.
     -- Fleet point cost down from 21 FP to 16 FP
     -- Supplies/month down from 22 to 19
  - Makhaira:
     -- Recieved a pair of built-in Yawarakai-Te variants, the Juuchi Yosamu
     -- Maximum crew capacity up from 12 to 16
     -- Fleet point cost down from 7 FP to 6 FP
     -- Supplies/month down from 8 to 7
  - Katzbalger:
     -- The Chrono Illusion system now spawns more illusions, and the illusions have more health
     -- Armor increased from 60 to 80
  - All Perturba missile weapons (Tizona, Colada, Excalibur) damage and EMP increased by ~30%
     > These were underperforming across the board, so it was about time they got a bit of love

 Bugfixes:
  - The Perturba Weapon Contract event is no longer bugged, and will properly show the dialogue it is meant to
     > It had issues showing around half of the intended dialogue; *whoops*
  - The Perturba Weapon Testing event now displays the proper exit dialogue
  - The Perturba Weapon Testing quest can now only raise your relations to Friendly, not Cooperative
  - The Perturba Weapon Testing quest now properly displays its relations-increase (it was 7, not 0.07 as shown)
  - You may now only ever have a single Perturba quest active at a time (including future quests): to get a new quest, either finish or quit your current one
  - Temporal Retreat no longer sneakily forgets to revert the top- and bottom-most armor grid rows
  - Fixed potential campaign bug allowing Vass fleets to spawn too close to the player if they had extreme sensor profiles
  - Fixed bug where ending Perturba's weapon contract would remove blueprint knowledge of their weapons even if gotten from other sources than the event (should rarely happen, but was possible)
     > Should rarely have happened, but was possible
  - Fixed a bug where Perturba's weapon contract event did not properly give access to the Tizona
     > How did I miss this for this long?

 Other:
  - Some minor performance improvements here and there
  - Typo fixes
     > Frankly, more than I like to admit


Version 0.3.3 : Time for some shaders
 General:
  - Added GraphicsLib support for normal maps on ships and [most] weapons
  - Added GraphicsLib light support for some guns and effects
  - Made Yawarakai Te FX fade out faster if the player is firing it while under influence (timeflow influence, that is)

 Balance:
  - Made Perturba Weapon Testing missions more profitable, and improved the relations bonus gotten from them

 Bugfixes:
  - You can no longer start a Weapon Testing event while already performing one
  - Fixed bug causing partially-fitted carriers to occassionally bug out the first Vass encounter
  - Fixed display bug for the Perturba version of the Vass hullmod (as of yet mission-exclusive)


Version 0.3.2d
 General:
  - Vass fleets should no longer hunt any mission-critical targets, including person bounties
     > This checks for a vanilla flag, so if you encounter a mod this still happens with, tell me

 Balance:
  - Makhaira:
     * Cargo space from 10 -> 24
     * Fuel from 20 -> 18
        > It's a smuggling ship, after all.
  - Schiavona:
     * Cargo space from 80 -> 60
     * Fuel from 80 -> 70
        > It's not a smuggling ship, after all.
  - Yawarakai-Te:
     * DPS from 170 -> 210

 Bugfix:
  - Fixed missing memory key in the weapon-contract event preventing you from ever getting the weapon-testing event
     > I also included a new Console Command to fix this for anyone who has already taken the weapon-contract event: just do the command "VassMeetPerturbaContact" and you're good to go


Version 0.3.2c
 Bugfix:
  - Removed the no-autofit tag from Vass ships, as it caused issues with custom orders and some modded hullmods
  - Ensured prototypes do not drop from most "mundane" sources
  - Fixed a bug causing Yawarakai-Te weapons use more flux than intended when firing without a target
  - Made the "clean up all data" console command... actually clean all data. Or, well, all I've found.


Version 0.3.2b
 Bugfix:
  - Removed massive debug logs spawning all the time
     > How did I miss this, now again?


Version 0.3.2a
 General:
  - Made Vass punishment fleets considerably more common at low Vass Power, and slightly more common at high ones
  - Increased spawn delay for Vass Punishment fleets slightly
  - Stopped the Vass from attempting to extort battlestations

 Bugfixes:
  - Fixed the Perturba Weapon Testing event not being finishable
  - The Debug flag is no longer enabled for the Perturba Weapon Testing event; it should no longer appear all the time regardless of condition
  - Fixed the intel description for the Perturba Weapon Testing event
  - Fixed Perturba Prototypes auto-disabling themselves in combat at times
  - Fixed Perturba Prototypes having more target leading issues than intended
     > This quest was quite broken on release! I'm sorry for that, hopefully the big issues are now fixed
  



Version 0.3.2: Time for a new quest
 General:
  - Added a new repeatable quest for Perturba after you've met their contact
	> This one's almost my favorite addition, and has some interesting mechanics behind it. There'll be more additions to it later
  - Added basic faction description
  - Updated some text for the initial Perturba quest
  - Added a pair of Command Console commands for manipulating Vass standing and resetting the mod practically back to square 1
	> Mostly in case people want to change their approach between patches without needing an entirely new savefile. Use at own risk, though, it's not 100% stable in all situations
  - Added the Tizona Emitter, the first missile weapon of the families
  - Adjusted Chrono Jump visuals
	> No more particles, viva la trail!
  - Vass punishment fleets will now take a day or so before arriving, instead of instantly popping up the second you steal something
  - Slightly adjusted visuals and timing of the Asi, and gave it a new sound courtesy of MesoTroniK
  - Gave the Caladbolg a new sound courtesy of MesoTroniK


 Balance:
  - Fragarach Chronostimulus
     * damage per shot 530 -> 510
        > Minor nerf, wasn't really outrageously good in any way but always a solid PD pick. Might've been an unnecessary nerf honestly

  - Cyllel Farchog Array:
     * spread pattern slightly altered, more centered
     * flux per shot 75 -> 67
	> The poor Cyllel suffers from excessive flux and wierd spreading. This hopefully remedies that slightly

  - Estoc
     * weapon damage 1000x3 -> 700x3
     * weapon EMP 750x3 -> 525x3
     * deployment range 6000 -> 4000
     * flux capacity 800 -> 600
     * slightly improved engine performance: should have less issues firing its bombs now
        > Range and damage was just an oversight, it wasn't ever meant to be that high. Durability was a tad bit high when paired with the Curtana; the synergy is nice, but maybe a bit TOO nice. Engine performance changes mostly for AI benefit; not sure how much it actually contributed but it is worth a shot and seems to give minor improvements for me

  - Katzbalger
     * deployment range 6000 -> 4000
        > Same range oversight here


 Bugfixes:
  - Fixed some issues with the initial Vass encounter such as fighers not being taken and issues with fleet interception
  - The Baselard and Tuck should no longer incorrectly appear in various places
  - Safety Overrides no longer kills your crew in simulations
	> Oops.
  - Added Vass ships to Prism blacklist
  - Various fixes to the Colada Emitter
  - Vass fleets don't spawn against other factions nearly as excessively, now




Version 0.3.1c
 Bugfixes:
  - Removed crash error that sometimes appear when entering the refit screen


Version 0.3.1b
 General
  - Made Vass fleets no longer try and extort Remnant and Derelict fleetsm because that's silly
  - Made the Combat Carrier Curtana variant slightly less shit
  - Fixed minor spelling errors

 Bugfixes:
  - Hopefully made WIP fighters not spawn in prism freeport
  - Fixed spelling error causing the initial Perturba quest to never appear
  

Version 0.3.1a
 General:
  - Fixed color for design types
  - Changed color for weapon covers
  - Made initial bar quest twice as likely to appear
  - Added a pair of randomized missions that feature normal Vass fleets rather than Perturba Elites
  - Changed mission icons (still pretty much placeholder, though)
  - Added some minor forward-compatibility improvements

 Balance:
  - Colada Emitter: 
     * tripled shots/burst (this was just bugged, really)

 Bugfixes:
  - The Perturba initial quest can now appear on any player market if they have ship-production capabilities, not just the market WITH ship production


Version 0.3.1 : Time for a small update
 General:
  - Added most missing descriptions

 Balance:
  - Dyrnwyn blaster: 
     * flux per shot 70 -> 80
     * Damage per shot 65 -> 80
  - Cyllel Farchog Array:
     * flux per shot 65 -> 75
     * Damage per shot 65 -> 80
  - Yawarakai-Te:
     * Damage/sec 140 -> 170
     * Range 350 -> 400 ["effective" range of 250 unchanged: this is to give Perturba Elites more use of their +150 effective range]
  - Caladbolg Bombard:
     * Accuracy slightly improved

 Bugfixes:
  - The Perturba initial quest no longer freezes by doing certain dialogue actions
  - Added missing weapon to the initial Perturba quest


Version 0.3 : Time to start anew
 - Entire mod effectively rebuilt to work better and to support new mechanics
 - Too many changes to track for now
